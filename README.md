PPO-CartPole & LunarLander: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Stable Baselines3
ðŸš€ Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a powerful and popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) technique, on two classic Gymnasium environments: CartPole-v1 and LunarLander-v3.

The entire workflow, including setup, vectorized training, and visual evaluation, is contained within the companion Jupyter/Colab notebook (PPO_CartPole_LunarLander_SB3.ipynb).
