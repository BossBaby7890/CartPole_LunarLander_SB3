# PPO Reinforcement Learning on CartPole & LunarLander

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** using [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) to solve two classic reinforcement learning environments:

- **CartPole-v1**
- **LunarLander-v2**

The included Jupyter Notebook (`PPO_CartPole_LunarLander_SB3.ipynb`) trains agents on both environments and evaluates their performance.

## 📌 Project Overview
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn to interact with environments by maximizing cumulative rewards. PPO is a policy-gradient method that strikes a balance between simplicity, sample efficiency, and performance stability.

This project applies PPO to:
- **CartPole**: A simple control environment where the agent must balance a pole on a cart.
- **LunarLander**: A more challenging environment where the agent must land a spacecraft safely.
